# Instantpy


### What is Instantpy ?

Instantpy is a small multiplatforms application written in Python allowing to send some short instant messages to other 'friends' computers.

### How it works ?

Each computer has a client/server service which allows to exchange via an Ethernet link.

### For which platforms ?

The Python language is pretty portable, that is why Instantpy should be able to exchange between each platforms supporting it, supposing that the Libraries used for this application are also compatible.
For instance, that means that a Windows PC should be able to exchange with a Linux one without any issues.
